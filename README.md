# FileRenamer
The name speaks for itself, but it is a special file renamer. You can rename mass of files using your own pattern with a counter and you can set the counter’s length. For example, you have a lot of picture files made with a mobile phone. These files have a special name depend on the gadget. Maybe you want to rename these picture files in this manner: Christmas_2015_0001, Christmas_2015_0002,... So, in this case the pattern is Christmas_2015_ and the counter starting number is 1 and the counter’s length is 4. The application does not modify file extensions. Maybe this is my first work where the objects are truly well-defined, the code is really pure, it is easy to understand. With this project, I learnt that practice makes perfect and practice is never enough.
